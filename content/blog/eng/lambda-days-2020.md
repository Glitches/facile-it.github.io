Lambda Days 2021
----------------

This year, a team from Facile attended for the first time to [Lambda Days](https://www.lambdadays.org/lambdadays2020) Conference in the beautiful polish city of Crakow.
It was been a two day full immersion, where the organizers gathered people from all over the world
to showcase the latest trends and academic research in the functional world.

This conference totally worth attending, the talks were high quality, and

#John Hughes one of Haskell creators presented his QuickCheck library
He suggested first to write pure function as much as you can and creating properties by which test conditions can be automated.

#Thorsten Altenkirch from the University of Nottingham gave a talk about implementing dependent types
The idea is creating output types tied to some input condition.

#Tomas Petricek from the Alan Turing Institute showed his tools library for data journalism
He presented this library written in f#, and with a live demo built some graphs highlighting the endless possibilities given from the composability.

#Juliano Alves, Senior Software Engineer @TransferWise talked about refined types in Scala
